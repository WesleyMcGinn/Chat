# Chat

## To do:
Most of the programming for Chat is done, but here is what there is left to do:
 - Separate program into several files for organization
 - Make Chat Chrome Extension
 
 **Note:** _The following description and list of main features is describing the completed Chat program, not as it is currently._

## Description:
A fairly simple chat system in which you can create your own chat room and use it at any time.  You can even generate links that will automatically enter your name, chat room ID, and chat room password.  With scarcely any loading time, this program works on new and very old web browsers.  Basically, if a web browser supports javascript, then it will most likely support every required functionality of this program.  This program is availible on any device with a web browser, including Linux Devices.  It is also available as a chrome extension.

## List of main features:
 - Chat room generating where you can enter a word, number, or phrase as your chat room ID.
 - Chat room protection with optional password option.
 - Generating links that will automatically enter your name, room ID, and password into the website.
 - Messages can be written in HTML, which allows bold, italics, underline, strikethrough, audio, pictures, and more.*
 - Very little loading time.
 - Works well on nearly any device with any web browser that can support javascript.
 - Works well on Linux Devices, such as Raspberry Pi.
 - Available as a Chrome extension.  With this extension, one click can take you to your chat room at any time.
 - Free, with no cost to users and no "upgrade plan" or advertisements to tempt you.
 
 ##### \*Note: Any media in a message (e.g. Pictures, audio, videos) must be linked elsewhere - you cannot upload files to this chat.  Get the link to a media by right-clicking on it and selecting "copy image address" or "copy audio address", etc.  You can get links to your own files by uploading them to something like [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com).
