# Chat

## Summary:
A fairly simple chat system in which you can create your own chat room and use it at any time.  You can even generate links that will automatically enter your name, chat room ID, and chat room password.  With scarcely any loading time, this program works on new and very old web browsers.  Basically, if a web browser supports javascript, then it will most likely support every required functionality of this program.  This program is availible on any device with a web browser, including Linux Devices.  It is also availible as a chrome extension.  You can also embed any chat room into your website!

 ##### \*Note: Any media in a message (e.g. Pictures, audio, videos) must be linked elsewhere - you cannot upload files to this chat.  Get the link to a media by right-clicking on it and selecting "copy image address" or "copy audio address", etc.  You can get links to your own files by uploading them to something like [Google Photos](https://photos.google.com).
